# 简介
> Machine learning is the field of machine learning is concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that automatically improve from experience. - T. Mitchell (1997)

> Data mining is the extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from data.

# 回归

## 线性回归假设

* Linearity:
  The relationship between 𝑥 and the mean of 𝑦 is linear.
* Homoscedasticity:
  The variance of residual is the same for any value of 𝑥.
* Independence:
  Observations are **independent** of each other.
* Normality:
  For any fixed value of 𝑥, 𝑦 is **normally** distributed.

# 代价函数
# 均方误差 - 概率解释
# 概率与统计的比较

Probability(deduce)	
* reasons from **populations** to **samples**
* This is deductive reasoning, and is usually sound (in the logical	sense of the word
  
Statistics (estimate)
* reasons from **samples** to **populations** 
* This is inductive reasoning, and is usually unsound (in the logical samples	reasons sense of the word)
